This is a small example of performing Kubernetes [custom
resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
validation using the same machinery utilized by the API server. It is meant to
serve as a companion to the ["How Kubernetes Validates Custom

post.
